# spatial-popgen

## About this repository 
This repo accompanies my master's thesis on spatial population genetics. The repo may be useful to those who wish to understand how to approach questions in population genetics computationally, or to those who wish to use similar methods to explore their own hypotheses.

An almost identical version of this repo exists in a [separate repo](https://github.com/dg622cam/thesis_code) linked to my university email account (which expires). Both repositories were authored by myself, Dexter Goodkind. 

The code in this repo is based on work from my project for the University of Cambridge MPhil in Computational Biology. I have my supervisor, Dr Aylwyn Scally, to thank for his extensive support during the project. 

I recommend reading, or at least skimming through, the sections of the [written thesis](/thesis_written.pdf) to give context to the contents of the repo. The folder names (with their numbers) in this repo correspond to sections in the written thesis. 


## Contents
The project is titled "Investigating the spread of ancestry using forward spatial population genetic simulations". This is done using SLiM 3.0[^1], a specific framework for forward genetic simulation. In particular, I explored results from Olalde et al. 2018[^2], which imply that approximately 90% of Britain's gene pool was replaced in the years 2450BC-1000BC. For more details, see the [written thesis](/thesis_written.pdf).
